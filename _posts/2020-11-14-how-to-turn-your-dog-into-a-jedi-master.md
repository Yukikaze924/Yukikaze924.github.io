Life for millions of dogs and cats in China is dangerous. Some are abandoned pets, left to fend for themselves after being dumped by their owners. Many are strays born on the streets.Government authorities organise brutal killing campaigns in an attempt to reduce stray dog and cat populations. Animals Asia has rescued many dogs, cats, puppies and kittens who have suffered horrendous abuse at the hands of people who see them as 'pests' — such as puppy abuse, when the dog pictured below was scalded with boiling water and thrown from a high rise building. And kitten abuse, with a disabled kitten abandoned on the streets. And these are not the only dangers they face…

> According to the International Humanitarian Association, approximately 10 million dogs and 4 million cats are killed and consumed in China every year, including some stolen pets. Yulin City in Guangxi holds a dog meat festival every June

Dogs and cats of all shapes and sizes, many of them family pets still wearing their collars, are snatched from the streets and forced into tiny cages. Many suffer broken limbs as they are transported vast distances, without food or water, to meat markets.

## Legal Protection of Domestic Animals

Many developed countries have formulated animal protection laws, focusing on protecting domestic animals.

The Federal Animal Protection Act of the United States stipulates that maltreating dogs is subject to economic penalties or legal sanctions, and even imprisonment. Except for the passage of the Federal Animal Protection Act by the United States Congress, almost every state and even small town in the United States has corresponding laws and regulations for dog ownership. Even in residential areas, there are some own "township rules and regulations". Each state's laws require sufficient space to be left when tying dogs, and dogs cannot be locked in relatively narrow areas. The regulations of the Animal Protection Association stipulate that the owner or guardian of a dog shall not allow the dog to stay at home alone for more than 10 hours.

The UK passed the Animal Protection Act as early as 1911, and has since introduced more laws such as the Zoo Animal Protection Act, Wildlife Protection Act, Experimental Animal Protection Act, and Livestock Transport Act. Violation may result in prosecution, fines, or even imprisonment. People who abuse Cruelty to animals will be prohibited from raising any animals for a period of time or for life.

French cats and dogs are happier, as they all need to register, file, and obtain health certificates. They even have identification numbers.

## Where to go for non domestic animals

At present, many countries have promulgated relevant laws to protect wild animals, but basically to maintain Balance of nature. For example, the Indian government has passed a "Tiger Constitution", which stipulates that tigers cannot be arbitrarily hunted and killed, and violators will be punished in accordance with the law; The UK has passed a law prohibiting the hunting of bats and requiring the protection of bat nests, with violators fined £ 1000; China also has a Wildlife Protection Law, and recently, due to the impact of the epidemic, legislation has been strengthened. But there are few protections for animals based on their own status and rights.

The concept of "Animal welfare" is introduced here. "Animal welfare" was first proposed by Hughes, an American scholar, in 1976. It refers to "a state of complete mental and physical health in which animals are in harmony with their environment." (New Exploration of Ecological Law) Animal welfare, especially the living conditions of animals, refers to all animals, not just domestic animals. The emergence of Animal welfare is the product of the development of human civilization and the improvement of human thought, laying the foundation for the protection of the basic survival rights of all animals (not only animals close to humans).

In the absence of a clear legal regulation, there are many arguments about Cruelty to animals. Some people believe that people who interfere with Cruelty to animals have no legal basis and may violate the privacy of the abuser (abuse at home). Indeed, the prohibition of Cruelty to animals can only be regarded as morality, but for correct morality with significant social impact, efforts should be made to raise it to the law.

Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis `code element` montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

```js
// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console

// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
// > 8
